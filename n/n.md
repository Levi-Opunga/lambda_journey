Human emotion can be whirl pool of  different feelings. I personally don't know how to keep my emotions in check and I think  at times I hurt people's feelings and also my own feelings. Sometimes we over expect and wind up hurting ourselves. I really don't know but I always say everything when i feel it. Whether it's the right thing i don't know but what I know is that I've been eaten up by my feelings one too may times to choose hiding them as an option. I think very many things in my life have led me to be a very odd person. I'm reclusive and choose to stay in my shell and don't let people in. Often when I've let people in, I'm the one who hurts them and they turn away. I'm not afraid of letting people in though, I just know that with each new connection I make the intensity of deepness reduces. There are some extraordinary circumstances and those few one in a million situations are the ones that screw up your psyche and new people will have to spend most of  their time trying to convince that they aren't demons from your past. Take it from someone who's always been the demon in every situation it's not fun.

As time passes though you start to realize that the image that the world has of you is most likely not going to change. If you are the liar they will always see you as that, if you are the weak one regardless of how big and strong you get it will always see you as tiny, and if you are an option you will always be an option regardless of whether they'll be an alternative. I learned to swallow this bitter pill and be a pessimist rather than an optimist. When life gives you lemons better be grateful cause you could have as well been empty handed. As I earlier said I'm not quite sure whether it's my  emotions taking over or this is how I truly feel, all I know for sure is that my emotional sickness has got my acidity level through the roof.

At certain points human connection feels like torture have you ever just wanted to be alone like truly alone. Like only person in the planet kind of alone so that you can see whether your own company will drive you insane. Do you know how many things are flawed about you? Personally I know and it's everything yet I still wake up every day and act like I know what the hell I'm doing. So just look at the next person and see how they are just as hopeless as you are. Crying does help but when you can't cry what do you do. The old me would say hit a wall till you bleed or get something faintly sharp and see how tough your skin is. Right now I'll just tell you have a wank and when you get rich you'll hire a therapist to fix your retarded dick but you'll have saved your sanity. You're probably wondering who broke me right, well same here just that I know the answer but I still ask the  question because I refuse to admit it to myself.

I may only have one true friend in this world other than my mother because I have nothing in common with anyone and those that I did have I left them because I was searching for happiness. Either way nothing much has changed without them and they are moving fine without me. Further brings the resolution, everyone will be okay without you so don't stress you can move to  the Cayman Islands and they won't notice. People aren't bad but they ain't that great either, you can believe me cause I'm people am I don't like myself. I do realize self loathing is a sign of depression but either way my therapist deemed me mentally sane a few years ago so I'm still certified.

I recall a time in my life when music saved me, every night I'd listen to Kygo at 3 am, the golden only to await suicidal messages from people I'd just met recently and it would remind me how sane I was and how lucky I was that I had people I could confide in that weren't strangers. Emphasis on the "had" take it as is. That was a really weird time when after hearing that someone was dead all that was said is finally one less person to talk too. The dark days or should they be nights cause days mean a false hope of of light at so point. Well there is no point to anything I'm saying but as long as it makes you uncomfortable I'll be happy because I'm also uncomfortable with myself. Probably the reason why I won't make it past 30. Its been fun lemme go do something useful with my life, I'll be back another day I get hit by pangs of depression.
