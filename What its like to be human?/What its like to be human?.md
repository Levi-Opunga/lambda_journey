## I think my favorite trait about myself is being human

**Some bit of truth before the fiction starts**

It's been a really long time since I expressed myself in a way like this. I don't really know what prompted this but it feels right. I am really grateful for everything I have and the people in my life though still a feeling of would be better *without* some of them exists. Especially the past year, I don't know how to say this but I experienced the first semblance of what it feels like to be normal. I've met people who make me feel like I'm not an outsider, I have had such people who've been that for me, no lie but it was always a transition of you are very weird to you aren't that bad and appreciate that it just shows what it's like to be human. ***It's also human to hold resent for such, so should I feel sorry for that?***

Feeling like there's a lot of emotions held back towards so many things and so many people, I can consequently say to say the amount of negative emotions associated with people in my life might be surmountable to the amount of love. But not all of them, and those are the only ones I should logically intend on keeping for a long term. I sometimes don't understand but I don't want people who've been there for me in my life cause all I see is the sadness I have experienced than the love they give. It's so sad that the people who are supposed to be the cause of joy in your world are now consequently the cause of self loathing and unexplained depressive moments. I don't want to bleed just to know that I'm alive, sometimes have you even wished that live was an actual game and you could hit pause or reset back to the time when nothing really mattered and you were just a kid rolling in the field and you could see a future with a happy ever after. I feel like one day I might decide to disappear off the face of the earth but I feel as though I don't have the strength to do that so I'll just keep it as a thought

*Rejection.*

Why then do you let yourself feel and think that way? From someone who always says everything in life is a choice I feel like I actively choose to be negative and have so much anger boiled up inside me. It's to a point that I almost convinced myself that being stupid is an active choice and I feel like I am choosing to be dumb to not believe that I'm not in control of any feelings in my life. Why am I afraid of telling the truth to myself? It's funny we can always point out when anyone else is on the wrong, is it a form of self love trying to protect ourselves from certain levels of self guilt or is it an injustice we are doing to ourselves. What do you like about yourself? I can't think of anything. That's what you've done to me, no take responsibility you're a man stop letting yourself down

so it's all my fault,

**Where are you?** Are you drowning, are you cold and alone. **Are you running?** I can't let them catch me down they'll rip me apart. I don't know them but I'm so scared. I can't let my past catch me down. Can you look back and see you are not the same, they don't see it though the wound are too deep are too deep to just be healed by time.Finding the root cause of why I hate the world so much and why I call it the world and in essence it's the people in it,

$$Who\; am \;I\; afraid\; hurting \;if\; I\; am \;direct \;and \;call \;out \;my \;trauma\; by\; it's\; name?$$

Not so long ago I was fore warned it's really stupid to fall for someone who is not okay but what do we do when surrounded by a world of individuals where each one is as broken as the next to a point that when you actually find someone that isn't broken you have to strip them of that happiness and joy and make them to be just as broken as you are, first question should have been am I okay before I go ahead and break her heart?

**Why is it just her heart?** The world taught me no one other than mother loves a man, and one who is never loved can't be broken.And one, who loves can they be broken? Or are they incapable of love. You make a resolve in the question as you question the intent of your affection.

Sadness comes to the world around him and he chooses a bold path for the first time. The world in shambles and in turmoil, the world weeps and reaches out you. I don't know what to say, why? Always had the wrong to say but when it comes time to speak there is nothing. Why are you sad I don't understand? I blame the drugs, I blame everything else other than the fact that you are human and fall sometimesI will not help you rise, I am strong you should be as me. Crawl before you walk, hold my hand please.
**Insensitive, I think the rest are crazy.**
I have to think of myself first, were it not yesterday selfless as the sun that lights up our day to no reward.

Am I still human or am I stripped of my humanity. Can I find some peace?
Well at least I have money
