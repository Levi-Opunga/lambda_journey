# Desperation

It has to be one of the strongest and rawest human emotions I have ever felt. I don't know how to precisely express how it feels like on words but what its not is empty, for sure because within it there's some weird tiny spec of undying hope and blind optimism. That is the most difficult thing about it due to the fact that if you kill hope its detrimental to the soul and yet the soul is what exactly we are trying to save.

## The Beginning

Honestly it was the happiest period of my life and genuinely didn't think anyone other than my mother would ever lay their eyes on me and be able to feel love for me. I don't know if i am an ugly person or not but one thing for sure i have always had problems worth my self image and still do have up-to now. *&quot;I'm quite simple and don't think much of myself but rather I think only of my flaws when i think of myself once&quot; ​*once said a boy who hadn't even yet been scared by the world but was already plagued with anxiety.

Nothing beats thrill of when it first clicks in your brain that nobody on the internet actually knows what you look like or cares who you or what you are or cares about what you were raised to believe in, they just take you by what you put effort in coming across as. There grows a false self-confidence afforded to you by lack accountability afforded to you. I could be whoever i wanted to be, I wasn't that lonely only raised by a loving an overcompensating single mom that had recently lost weight due to malnutrition in a boarding school. I was who the words an pictures spoke of me. Worst of all was young and without any sense of self-awareness yet I had been thrown in a den of self proclaimed idealists and intellectuals all trying to get their points across whether information or misinformation. I was like an absorbent sponge thrown in a cesspool of toxins and expected not to fill with vile things. I don't know of the results match with the expectations but you'll be the judge of that as we go on this journey of self discovery and reminiscence.

I felt free and unrestricted for the first time and I could simply say what i was feeling without consequence to a bunch of strangers who I felt a meaningless yet deep connection forged by lack of care masqueraded as lack of judgement and acceptance. Months on end my insights on many on  various topics changed and i started to question, wonder, to imagine , to think, read , conclude and forge opinions of my own. Frankly I cannot say the opinions formed were my thoughts purely rather a culmination of various newly acquired influences. Intellectual satisfaction, a new unmatched feeling or that's what I thought.
